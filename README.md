I ONLY NEED JAVASCRIPT, NOT A NEXT GET JS, JUST THE JS TOUCH, YOU KNOW IT.

Hi guys! I will make it short, I hate to see these companies taking advantage of filipin@s trying to learn spanish, aside from asking a lot of money 
they don't give a fk for teaching you spanish and making sure you actually learn! So help me (and hopefully other devs and bilinguals) to create a website
that will contain important info for filipin@s trying to learn spanish. It going to be video-oriented but the big difference is that me (and I hope other
bilingual filipinos) will make sure the videos DO NOT contain mistakes and they are easy to understand, something that youtube lacks a fking lot.

I can't pay because I know the love from filipin@s to filipin@s is big enough to make this run for free, aside from that I will put you in the aboutUs 
so that you can use it in your CV or something like that, of course I ain't setting u there for 1 line commit.

Don't get me wrong, I am not after money. 

Gracias
